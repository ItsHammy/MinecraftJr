  A Python Server Client for Bedrock Edition

  I'm planning to release to public in November

## About
  PM-MP is very limited and hard to work with, shit, there's not even default mob spawning without plugins.
  I got sick of this and decided to make a Python server software for bedrock gameservers!
  It runs on the default Minecraft Bedrock Server Software but has the ability for plugins.
  Please make sure you enable cheats in `server.properties`
