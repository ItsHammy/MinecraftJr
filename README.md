  A Python Server Client for Bedrock Edition | PLANNING TO RELEASE IN NOVEMBER uwu

# About
  PM-MP is very limited and hard to work with, shit, there's not even default mob spawning without plugins.
  I got sick of this and decided to make a Python server software for bedrock gameservers!
  If you need help with the library, software or have any other questions, Join my discord here:

  The docs are mostly in HTML form, please download them as a zip and navigate through, it's designed to be accessible offline uwu

  See all the new features first on bedrock.teammage.org, the #1 Anarchy server for bedrock!

As much as I love making and maintaining this, it does take a lot of time, please consider donating to me a couple of dollars at http://buymeacoffee.com/daddyhammy
